# ROBI2.hu

This project was made in [Angular](https://angular.io).

## Personal website
This is my personal website, hosted on [robi2.hu](https://robi2.hu). This was my first individual Angular project. The blog is built on the Contentful API, which I would like to replace with my own in the future.

## Portfolio
I list some of my previous publicly available projects on this site.

## Development state
I only working on this site in parts of my free time, so obviously it's far from perfect. However I want to optimize and add more features in the future.

## Roadmap
- Test: There's no test specified yet, which is a big mistake.
- My own blog API with content delivery: I would like to do this with NestJS.
- Refactor SCSS: Make it more structured and readable.
- Multilang: Site content language is only hungarian, but it would be better if the site is also available in english.
- CI/CD: Automatic deploy to the web with GitHub Actions.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
